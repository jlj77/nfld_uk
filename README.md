My static site, built with [Sakura](https://oxal.org/projects/sakura), and
powered with [mkws](https://mkws.sh).

I've customised the latter a tad, to generate a simple RSS feed based on changes
to files associated with [our book club](https://nfld.uk/bookclub_master.html).

This process relies on a cron job, the shell script for which is stored in
`bin/`.
